This is information about the ``patch'' for the oblig 2.


Note: as I don't know to which extent the original structure has been
changed in a given group, this material is NOT intended to work
``out-of-the-box'' for everyone (or even the majority).


Again, it's meant has (helpful) guidelines of what to to.

The oblig is specified as the second part of the Compila19 document (type
checking and code generation). Therefore, also the documentation how do
make use of the given library needs to be consulted. The documentation is
(in your original project) under ~/doc/:




#+begin_example
 ./bytecodeinterpreter
 ./languagespec
  ./obligs
#+end_example


If you did not delete that part from your repos, it should still be
there. Otherwise it's still browsable at

    https://github.uio.no/msteffen/compila

I also included slides that cover oblig2 here.


So much for the background information. As far as code is concerned given
in this patch:


  - ~./src~ : that contains new code, namely the implementation of the byte code and run-time
              support library and some code for testing. 

             There is also a ``new'' version of the ~Compiler.java~ file.
            It is basically an extension the the older file, that was provided
	    as starting point. Basically, you should adapt your ~Compiler.java~ file
	    accordingly (most people made adaptations from the starting version, so
	    that's one of the points where you cannot expect that the newly proposed
	    inspirational version will just work for you directly.



          Move the directories to a place that suits your compiler (perhaps as
	   subdirectories of src, but some people changed also that)



   - ~./build.xml~ : analogous remarks also here. you will perhaps have worked with
                     ant (as suggested) and may have taken the previous
                  ~build.xml~ as start point (but perhaps adapted things).  Again: this
                  one is a suggestion on how to extend your build-file to support the new
                  needs and target. 

		    In particular, code generation and the tests etc. MUST
                    BE AUTOMATED and executable (for me) in an EASY manner.



    - test files: For the test-compila-files: I include them here in the
      patch, there are files for testing the 

           1) type checker and the static       analysis phase
	   2) code generator

      For the first ones: they are separated into those which should work
      and those where the type checker should report an error.
