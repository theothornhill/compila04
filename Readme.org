* Introduction
This is my attempt on the first obligatory exercise in INF5110 on UiO. The first
exercise is to build a lexer and parser for a provided grammar/language, and
produce its abstract syntax tree.
* How to build and run
You need to have =ant= on your system, which also is recommended tool for this
exercise. It has been tested locally on my machine, and also on UiO over ssh
Run all commands from root of git repository:
** Cleaning
#+NAME: clean
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
ant clean
#+END_SRC

** Building
#+NAME: build
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
ant build
#+END_SRC

** Running
#+NAME: test-run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
ant run
#+END_SRC

* Results of test-run
