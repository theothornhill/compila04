To ``install'' this patch you may to concatenate the text from
build.xml.patch.xml to the old build.xml.  If you did not change anything
in Compiler.java in assignment 1, it should be ok to just overwrite the old
Compiler.java with the new one. Otherwise, adapt what needs to be adapted.



If you do this the run target from assignment 1 will be broken because of
the constructor in Compiler.java.  It is not required that this target
works and you can either safely remove that target (not nice to have broken
targets), or fix the target

The rest of the files should be easily added in.
